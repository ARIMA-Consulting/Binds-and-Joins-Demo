# Binds-and-Joins-Demo
Demo code for how to merge multiple data sets with binds and joins in R.

This project is designed to walk new to intermediate users of R through a simple example of how to create and combine data where each table does not have exactly the same column names and lengths. The principles here can be applied to data sets with 15 data points or 15 billion data points. 

I start by creating the data with simple vectors then combining them into data frames. I then run through different kinds of errors and what they mean. After that, I rename the columns and show when rbind and various joins work or don't work with a resolution of a merged data set.

Please reach out with suggestions for future work! I am all ears!
